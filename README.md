### How it works
##### ‚ùì‚ùì‚ùì
##### Crafting
You will be able to craft the different colored bricks by using their similar color dye.
(Crafting Image)

##### Functionality
You will be able to right-click on the already colored, and placed, bricks to color it's concrete color and after that change it's concrete color to black, giving it an amazing decoration style!

##### Goals
###### üéØüéØ
1. Adding all the color bricks options
2. Multiple color concrete options (ex. redbricks with green concrete)
3. Improve on functionality

##### Suggestions
###### ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
1. Ideas for a paint brush type mod even, coloring other blocks as well.
2. White concrete option with the black concrete option

### Sources

##### [Minecraft Wiki Fandom](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki) 
They include a [dyes section](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye) covering everything from obtaining them too even their Color values, Sounds and Achievements!
I used their statement about all the colored dyes and their default HEX values.

### Formula
##### ‚ûï‚ûñ‚ûó
The default minecraft bricks block texture has a set shading based of the red HEX value color, therefore I could use the normal values of the color and work out a relation betwwen the shading in the colors.

Here is the formula in a step-by-step manner :
(S = shading; b = Basecolor (Value of HEX)) <br />
![](https://github.com/LudwigBooysen/MC-ColoredBricks/blob/main/Images/pack.png) <br />
`S1 = b` <br />
`S2 = S1 - 8` <br />
`S3 = S2 - 9` <br />
`S4 = S3 - 6` <br />
`S5 = S4 - 6` <br />
`S6 = S5 - 3` <br />

### How to contribute

Feel free to leave me suggestions for the code or even commment on them. You can contact me any way you prefer, check [My Webite](https://github.ludwigbooysen.io/index.html) for more contact info!
If you want this project to expand or be cusotmized to your choice, feel free to contact me about that as well. (NOTE: Donating will prioritize your order!)
Requesting a pull request might not even be need as, as if now, the project only has one branch but my response time is usally between 4-8 hours depending on the day, obviously.
