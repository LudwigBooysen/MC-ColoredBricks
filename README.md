I used their statement about all the colored dyes and their default HEX values.

> A questionare will be handed out every week to choose the next 3 color bricks wich I will be adding

### Formula
##### ➕➖➗
The default minecraft bricks block texture has a set shading based of the red HEX value color, therefore I could use the normal values of the color and work out a relation betwwen the shading in the colors.

Here is the formula in a step-by-step manner :
(S = shading; b = Basecolor (Value of HEX)) <br />
![](https://github.com/LudwigBooysen/MC-ColoredBricks/blob/main/Images/pack.png) <br />
`S1 = b` <br />
`S2 = S1 - 8` <br />
`S3 = S2 - 9` <br />
`S4 = S3 - 6` <br />
`S5 = S4 - 6` <br />
`S6 = S5 - 3` <br />

### How to contribute

If you want this project to expand or be cusotmized to your choice, feel free to contact me about that as well. (NOTE: Donating will prioritize your order!)
Requesting a pull request might not even be need as, as if now, the project only has one branch but my response time is usally between 4-8 hours depending on the day, obviously.
