**How It Works**:
  - End goal is to add all the color bricks based of minecrafts dye hex colors
  - I will be adding a normal color, colred one (cement in between is colored) and black cement.
  - Minecraft Wiki with HEX info for dyes: https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dye

**Functionality**:
  - I plan to make the normal bricks block colorable,
  - ex: 
  - 1. you right-click on the bricks with blue dye once it wil color it normally
    2. right-clicking twice will color the cement as well
    3. right-clicking with black dye on any twice clicked block will color the cement black
