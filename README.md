# MC-ColoredBricks

### Colored Bricks in Minecraft!

**How It Works**:
  - End goal is to add all the color bricks based of minecrafts dye hex colors
  - I will be adding a normal color, colred one (cement in between is colored) and black cement.

**Functionality**:
  - I plan to make the normal bricks block colorable,
  ex. 1. you right-click on the bricks with blue dye once it wil color it normally
      2. right-clicking twice will color the cement as well
      3. right-clicking with black dye on any twice clicked block will color the cement black
